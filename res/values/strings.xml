                For zer0Sound to function properly, it needs to be able to access your Google Now text box.\n 
                \n
                That way, the app will be able the handle tasks like :\n
                - \"raise the volume\"\n
                - \"skip that track\"\n
                - \"suffle\"\n
                - \"stop playing\"\n
                - \"...\"\n
                \n
                Enjoy using zer0Sound !
